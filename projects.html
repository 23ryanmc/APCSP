    <p class="f">I made this octopus mug in ceramics class and it felt like my first good project of the year. I spent a long time sketching, planning, and making this project, and it really improved my ceramic skills. </p>

    <p class="f">I made this collage in history and it is just one of three collages about US during the Vietnam War. Each collage has a paragraph that goes along with it that explains the theme of the collage. In this collage it shows the importance of student activism during the war. This was a good accomplishment because I was able to use my artistic and analytical skills to make it.
